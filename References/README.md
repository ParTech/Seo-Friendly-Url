# Sitecore.Kernel.dll

This file is part of the Sitecore API and has only been added here so that the solution will build straight away after cloning the Git repository.  
**You should not copy this file to your own solution**, but rather change the reference to use your own Sitecore.Kernel.dll  

The pre-build module binary (ParTech.Modules.UrlRewriter.dll) will work with all recent Sitecore versions (6.5 and higher) and does not need to be re-compiled.
